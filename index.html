    <!--INTRODUCTION-->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <img id="logo" src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo for Breath of the Wild">
        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild was a 2017 game released for the WiiU and Nintendo Switch. The game completely reimagined the Zelda franchise, introducing new mechanics and a fresh story (no major spoilers are in this website).
        However, the game also provided a perfect introduction to Zelda for people looking to get into the franchise.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">This website contains the following information about the game:</span>

    <!--GAMEPLAY-->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h1 id="C2">Gameplay</h1>
        <p>Breath of the wild is completely different to any previous Zelda game - as it has a completely open world design. After completing the Great Plateau (which is essentially the tutorial area) - the player is allowed to roam around wherever they want - Technically this means they can go straight to Calamity Ganon (the final boss) if they wanted to!
            This completely open world design means that you can choose whatever pathway you want to go through the game - and can complete the quests in whatever order you want.
            <br>The main quest that the whole game essentially revoles around is to 'defeat Calamity Ganon' - and to help do so you can defeat four divine beasts.
            
            <br><br>To help you on this quest, there is an assortment of weapons, shields and bows to help you on this journey. Every item has a limited amount of durability, and each item also has different characteristics (such as dealing more damage or defending against more damage). However, due to the limited durability it is recommended to plan what you use and when; so you save your better items for the harder quests in the game.

            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <img id="mapbasic" src="/images/map.jpeg" alt="A basic map of Breath of the Wild">

        </div>
            
        <p><br>When first starting out, the map will look empty. To add areas to the map, you need to visit Sheikah Towers to update your Sheikah Slate. To open your Sheikah Slate, press the '-' button.
        <br>The map has a host of useful features, the main one being the ability to fast-travel to any previously completed shrine/sheikah tower - which is extremely helpful considering the vast size of the map.
        <br>Furthermore, the map feature has the option for stickers - which allow you to mark out areas that may be useful (for example minibosses). Similarly, the map also has the option to set waypoints - the difference being
        that waypoints show up on your minimap and when you look through the Sheikah Camera - allowing you to navigate to certain areas on the map. However, you can only set up to 5 of these at a time.

    <!--SHRINES-->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h1 id="C4">Shrines</h1>
        <p>Throughout the map, there are 120 shrines. These can be largely categorised into three different types:
            <ul>
                <li>Puzzle Shrines</li>
                <li>Test of Strength Shrines</li>
                <li>Blessing Shrines</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>At it's core, each shrine is the same; in the sense that the shrine involves a puzzle that the player must solve, and as a reward you recieve a 'Spirit Orb', however each different type of shrine tests the player in a different way.
            <br>Once the player has finished the shrine, they interact with a Monk, who gifts Link a Spirit Orb. These Spirit Orbs can then be exchanged for extra Hearts or Stamina wheels
            <br>Additionally, all shrines contain at least one (maybe hidden) chest. If the player finds this chest, the icon of the shrine of the map will display a symbol to indicate this.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/chest.jpeg" id="chest" alt="A picture of the treasure chest icon on a map">
        <p style="text-align:center";><i>An image of the icon which means the chest has been found</i></p>

        <h3>Puzzle Shrines</h3>
        <p>Puzzle shrines are the most common type of shrine, and will typically be out in the open for the player to find. On entering the shrine, Link will be presented with a puzzle which needs to be solved to complete the shrine (similar to mini dungeons in previous Zelda games)
            <br>The puzzles typically follow a 'theme', for example the shrine may heavily rely on a single mechanic such as a rune, gravity, or other aspect of the game that requires the player to think creatively. Rarely, the shrine may have an 'apparatus' instead which the player must manipiulate to solve the shrine
        </p>

        <h3>Test of Strength Shrines</h3>
        <p>Test of strength shrines can be categorised into three types:
            <ul>
                <li>A Major Test of Strength</li>
                <li>A Modest Test of Strength</li>
                <li>A Minor Test of Strength</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>These shrines involve the player fighting a guardian scout, with the type determining the difficulty of the fight. Once the player defeats the guardian scout, the shrine is completed.</p>
        <img src="/images/guardian.png" id="guardian" alt="A picture of a guardian scout">
        <p style="text-align:center;"><i>An image of a Guardian Scout</i></p>

        <h3>Blessing Shrines</h3>
        <p>Blessing Shrines are almost impossible to come across in casual gameplay without a focus (or cheating and using a guide.) These shrines are used to reward the player when the challenge to reach a shrine is actually reaching the shrine.
            <br>Sometimes, these shrines are associated with a side-quest, and once the player finishes/reaches a certain point in the side-quest, the shrine is revealed. Or sometimes, the player is given riddles/hints by characters which the player must decipher to find the shrine's location.
            <br>Upon finding the shrine, instead of being greeted with a puzzle inside the shrine - the shrine can be completed instantly, as the puzzle itself was finding the shrine.

    <!--KOROKS-->
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h1 id="C5">Koroks</h1>
        <p>After reaching a certain point in the game, Link meets Hetsu, who has lost his pair of maracas. After Link finds the maracas for Hetsu, he is dissapointed there are no seeds inside (to shake the maracas). This then becomes possibly the longest quest in the game (if you complete it entirely).
            Scattered around the map, there are 900 Korok seeds, each with a different challenge to 'discover' them. Upon finding these korok seeds you can return to Hetsu who will take them and reward you with more inventory space for weapons, shields or bows.
            <br>To fully upgrade your inventory to hold the maximum amount of these items, you only need 441 seeds, broken down into 35 separate upgrades
            <br><br>If you do decide to collect all 900 Korok seeds, you may think you get an extra special prize. However, in reality the prize is a piece of poop, fittingly titled 'Hetsu's gift'
